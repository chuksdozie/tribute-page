            <p id="tribute-info">BIOGRAPHY</p>
            <p id="yheader"><b>1918-1934 - </b>Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, 
              then part of South Africa's Cape Province. Given the forename Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term 
              colloquially meaning "troublemaker", in later years he became known by his clan name, Madiba.
              His patrilineal great-grandfather, Ngubengcuka, was king of the Thembu people in the 
              Transkeian Territories of South Africa's modern Eastern Cape province.</p>

            <p id="yheader"><b>1934-1940 - </b>Intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor 
              for the Thembu royal house, in 1933 Mandela began his secondary education at Clarkebury Methodist
               High School in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans
                in Thembuland. Made to socialise with other students on an equal basis, he claimed that he 
                lost his "stuck up" attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began playing
                 sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening. He completed his Junior Certificate in 
                 two years, and in 1937 moved to Healdtown, the Methodist college in Fort Beaufort attended 
                 by most Thembu royalty, including Justice.</p>

            <p id="yheader"><b>1941-1943 - </b>Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that Jongintaba 
              had arranged marriages for him and Justice; dismayed, they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, 
              arriving in April 1941. Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his "first 
              sight of South African capitalism in action", but was fired when the induna (headman) discovered 
              that he was a runaway. He stayed with a cousin in George Goch Township, who introduced Mandela
               to realtor and ANC activist Walter Sisulu. </p>

            <p id="yheader"><b>1943-1949 - </b>Mandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand, 
              where he was the only black African student and faced racism. There, he befriended liberal and 
              communist European, Jewish, and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First. Becoming 
              increasingly politicised, in August 1943 Mandela marched in support of a successful bus boycott to 
              reverse fare rises.</p>

            <p id="yheader"><b>1950-1954 - </b>Mandela took Xuma's place on the ANC national executive in March
               1950, and that same year was elected national president of the ANCYL. In March, 
               the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg, bringing together African, 
               Indian, and communist activists to call a May Day general strike in protest against apartheid 
               and white minority rule</p>

            <p id="yheader"><b>1955-1961 - </b>After taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the 
              forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg in February 
              1955, Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white 
              minority rule. On his advice, Sisulu requested weaponry from the People's Republic of China,
               which was denied.</p>

            <p id="yheader"><b>1961-1962 - </b>Disguised as a chauffeur, Mandela travelled around the country 
              incognito, organising the ANC's new cell structure and the planned mass stay-at-home strike. 
              Referred to as the "Black Pimpernel" in the press—a reference to Emma Orczy's 1905 novel The
               Scarlet Pimpernel—a warrant for his arrest was put out by the police.</p>

            <p id="yheader"><b>1962-1964 - </b>On 5 August 1962, police captured Mandela along with fellow activist 
              Cecil Williams near Howick. Many MK members suspected that the authorities had been tipped 
              off with regard to Mandela's whereabouts, although Mandela himself gave these ideas little credence.
              In later years, Donald Rickard, a former American diplomat revealed that the Central Intelligence 
              Agency, who feared Mandela's associations with communists, had informed the South African police of
               his location.</p>

            <p id="yheader"><b>1964-1982 - </b>In 1964, Mandela and his co-accused were transferred from Pretoria 
              to the prison on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years. Isolated from non-political
               prisoners in Section B, Mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell measuring 8 feet (2.4 m) by
                7 feet (2.1 m), with a straw mat on which to sleep. Verbally and physically harassed by several
                 white prison wardens, the Rivonia Trial prisoners spent their days breaking rocks into gravel,
                  until being reassigned in January 1965 to work in a lime quarry. Mandela was initially forbidden 
                  to wear sunglasses, and the glare from the lime permanently damaged his eyesight.</p>

            <p id="yheader"><b>1982-1988 - </b>In April 1982, Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Tokai,
               Cape Town, along with senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond
                Mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists 
                at Robben Island. Conditions at Pollsmoor were better than at Robben Island, although Mandela
                 missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island. Getting on well with Pollsmoor's commanding
                  officer, Brigadier Munro, Mandela was permitted to create a roof garden; he also read 
                  voraciously and corresponded widely, now permitted 52 letters a year.</p>

            <p id="yheader"><b>1988-1990 - </b>Recovering from tuberculosis exacerbated by the damp conditions in his 
              cell,[192] in December 1988, Mandela was moved to Victor Verster Prison near Paarl. He was housed in the 
              relative comfort of a warder's house with a personal cook, and he used the time to complete his LLB degree.
              [193] While there, he was permitted many visitors and organised secret communications with exiled ANC leader 
              Oliver Tambo.[194][195]
              In 1989, Botha suffered a stroke; although he would retain the state presidency, he stepped down as leader of
               the National Party, to be replaced by F. W. de Klerk</p>

            <p id="yheader"><b>1991-1992 - </b>Mandela proceeded on an African tour, meeting supporters and politicians in Zambia, 
              Zimbabwe, Namibia, Libya and Algeria, and continuing to Sweden, where he was reunited with Tambo, and London, where 
              he appeared at the Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa concert at Wembley Stadium</p>


              <p id="yheader"><b>2011-2013 - </b>In February 2011, Mandela was briefly hospitalised with a respiratory infection, 
                attracting international attention,[344][345] before being re-admitted for a lung infection and gallstone removal 
                in December 2012.[346][347] After a successful medical procedure in early March 2013,[348] his lung infection 
                recurred and he was briefly hospitalised in Pretoria. After suffering from a prolonged respiratory infection, 
                Mandela died on 5 December 2013 at the age of 95, at around 20:50 local time at his home in Houghton, surrounded 
                by his family.</p>
